|🏥 Support for volunteering    |1  |        |MoJ: 3 days paid + XX days unpaid. Imperial supports flexible hours, so would need to finish off my hours in the evening or weekend                                                                                                                                  |

|🏠️ Working from home          |1  |        |Imperial said _infrequently_ is ok. MoJ could be multiple days a week                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|🧠️ Side projects              |   |1       |Imperial support consulting + working with lots of interesting organisations. MoJ offer hackdays                                                                                                                                         |
|💆 Relaxed atmosphere          |1  |        |MoJ is a large department with opportunity to do things in a relaxed manner. Imperial is a smaller team, so the atmosphere may change during deadlines                                                                                                                 |
|👶️ Maternity/paternity support|1  |1       |Both have good support in different ways                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|⚡️ Interesting projects        |   |1       |Lots of fascinating projects to work on at Imperial. MoJ develops [prison software](/blog/learning-from-open-source/#%E2%9E%A1%EF%B8%8F-prisoner-categorisation---ministry-of-justice) + court software which is also interesting. Imperial is more varied however                                                                                                        |
|👌 Quality of code             |1  |        |Judging from respective GitHub projects, MoJ has an extremely high level of code quality along with tests. Imperial codebase has some room for improvement                                                                                                           |
|🍐 Peers                       |   |1       |Imperial team are a nice group of likeminded people. I don't know much about MoJ folk                                                                                                                                                                                |
|🌍 Diversity                   |1  |        |Imperial team is all guys. MoJ are much more diverse                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|📢 OSS + Evangelism            |1  |        |MoJ do blogging + OSS by default. Lots of writing to read online, documentation for their projects, retrospectives, interactive demos. Imperial have some open source code, couldn't find much blogging/written experiences. Both will support my conference speaking|
|📈 Career progression          |   |1       |More opportunity at Imperial. MoJ seems to only lead onto managerial roles                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|📐 Technology architecture     |1  |        |MoJ have established tools for CI/Testing/Deployments/Rollbacks/Code Review/Debugging/Development/Collaboration. Imperial is smaller and appears to have less in place (based on GitHub)                                                                             |
|💤 Lack of politics            |   |1       |Both have some, but Imperial better protects you from it                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|💻 Technologies                |   |1       |Imperial use very interesting + modern tech. MoJ are starting to use modern tech, but also have some legacy code                                                                                                                                                     |
